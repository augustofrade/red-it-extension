## 🛠️ Usage

### Basic Setup

1. **Install the extension** following the installation instructions above
2. **Click the Red-It icon** in your Firefox toolbar
3. **Open Settings** to configure your blocklist
4. **Add keywords** you want to block (one per line)
5. **Browse Reddit** and enjoy your filtered experience!

### Keyword Syntax

- **Content per line**: each line is a different keyword or phrase for the extension to use as filter
- **Exact match**: `javascript` - blocks posts containing "javascript"
- **Wildcard**: `java*` - blocks posts containing "javascript", "java", etc.
- **Case insensitive**: All keywords are matched case-insensitively

## ❔ Permissions

Below are the following permissions the extension requires and what they are used for:

- **Storage**: saving and retrieving user-defined rules to block content with.
- **Tabs**: opening settings page and displaying blocked subreddit page.
- **WebRequest, WebRequestBlocking**: detecting subreddit access to deny access to it in case the subreddit is set by the user to be blocked by the extension.

## ℹ️ About

The extension is called "red-it" because the posts were initially hidden by a red rectangle instead of a white or gray one.
Even after changing the colors, I liked that the name resembles the target website and also sounds like it blocks its content.
